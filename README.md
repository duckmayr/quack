This package exists largely for my own convenience, intended to provide LaTeX templates and other tools to easily automate some parts of the research production process while maintaining consistent style standards.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `quack` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("duckmayr/quack")
```
