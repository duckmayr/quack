# Course Description

Provide a brief course description.

# Course Objectives

When you complete the course, you will be able to:

- A
- B
- C

# Required Readings

The required text for the course is XXX.

There are other required short readings that will be available on Canvas.

# Course Assignments

List and describe the required assignments.

# Grading

Course grades are determined using a weighted average of the following four components:

- X%: Assignment 1
- Y%: Assignment 2

Letter grades will be awarded based on the following cutoffs:

```{r grade-cutoffs}
grades  = c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "F")
cutoffs = c( 94,   90,   87,  83,   80,   77,  73,   70,   67,  63,   60, "<60")
cutoffs = c(94, 90, 87, 83, 80, 77, 73, 70, 67, 63, 60, "$<60$")
kableExtra::kbl(
    x = data.frame(Grade = grades, Cutoff = cutoffs),
    align = "lr",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    escape = FALSE,
    table.envir = "center",
    linesep = ""
)
```

Please note: to ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage.
Thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999.
The University does not recognize the grade of A+.

I may choose to curve exam grades; if so, the curve will satisfy the following properties:

- No student will have a lower score after the curve than they had before it
- The rank ordering of individual grades will be preserved
- Higher scoring students will not be helped more by the curve than lower scoring students

# Course Policies

## Make-Up Exam Policy

The exam dates are listed below in the course schedule.
If you know of a compelling reason that you cannot be present during a scheduled exam, please contact me via email at least one week ahead of time to discuss scheduling a makeup exam.

If you miss an exam without previously scheduling a makeup exam, you will likely not be permitted to take the exam.
Only in extreme circumstances will makeup exams be permitted when not scheduled ahead of time.

## Regrading Policy

If you believe I have committed an error in grading your exam, please submit a regrade request to me in writing via email outlining the specific errors you have discovered and explaining why you believe them to be grading errors.
This request must be submitted within one week of receiving your graded exam.
